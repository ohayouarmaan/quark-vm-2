# ⚛️ ProtonVM

![logo](https://github.com/ohayouarmaan/quark-vm-2/blob/main/logo.webp)
**ProtonVM** is a general-purpose, secure, low-level virtual machine designed for maximal control, minimal abstraction, and memory safety. Built in **Rust**, it executes programs written in **QASM**, its custom assembly language. No registers, no garbage collection—just deliberate and explicit memory manipulation with powerful syscall support.

---

## 🔥 Key Features

- 🧠 **No Registers** – Purely stack-based execution with constant pool lookups.
- 💾 **Heap-Based Allocation** – All structured data lives in the managed heap.
- 🧊 **Raw Memory Buffer** – A sandboxed space for native syscalls and unsafe operations.
- 🔐 **Deep Security Model** – Hard separation of heap and raw buffer; corruption is virtually impossible.
- 📦 **QASM Assembly** – Lean and expressive instruction set for fine-grained control.
- 🧵 **Reference/Dereference Semantics** – Supports indirection across heap and raw buffer.
- 🛠️ **Native Syscalls** – Direct system-level interaction via QASM.

## 🧠 Memory Architecture

### 📚 Constant Pool

Immutable values (numbers, strings, etc.) are stored here and accessed via QASM instructions.

### 🧠 Heap

The main arena for dynamic allocation. Every data structure, value, or reference exists here unless explicitly allocated elsewhere.

### 💣 Raw Buffer

Used for native syscalls and low-level memory operations. Cannot be directly read—must be copied into the heap for access. Offers deep isolation to prevent data leaks and unintended mutations.

## 📖 QASM Instruction Set

ProtonVM instructions are defined in the following Rust enum:

```rust
pub enum InstructionType {
    INST_NOOP = 0,
    INST_PUSH,
    INST_POP,
    INST_ADD,
    INST_AND,
    INST_OR,
    INST_XOR,
    INST_NOT,
    INST_SHL,
    INST_SHR,
    INST_MUL,
    INST_DIV,
    INST_SUB,
    INST_JMPZ,
    INST_JMPEQ,
    INST_JMPNEQ,
    INST_JMPNZ,
    INST_PUSH_STR,
    INST_ALLOC,
    INST_ALLOC_RAW,
    INST_SYSCALL,
    INST_DUP,
    INST_INSWAP,
    INST_PRINT,
    INST_LOAD,
    INST_STORE,
    INST_DEREF,
    INST_REF,
    INST_DEBUG,
}
```

### 🔍 Common Instructions

| Instruction        | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `PUSH <val>`       | Pushes a constant value onto the stack. |
| `POP`              | Pops the top value from the stack. |
| `ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV` | Basic arithmetic on top two stack values. |
| `AND, OR, XOR, NOT` | Bitwise logic operations. |
| `SHL, SHR`         | Bit shifts. |
| `JMPZ`             | Jump if top of stack is zero. |
| `JMPNZ`            | Jump if top of stack is non-zero. |
| `JMPNEQ, JMPEQ`    | Conditional jumps. |
| `ALLOC <n>`        | Allocates `n` words in the heap. |
| `ALLOC_RAW <n>`    | Allocates `n` bytes in raw memory. |
| `STORE <i>`        | Stores top of stack in constant pool at index `i`. |
| `LOAD <i>`         | Loads from heap at index/address `i` to stack. |
| `REF`              | Pushes a reference (pointer) to the value on top of the stack. |
| `DEREF`            | Dereferences the pointer on top of the stack. |
| `SYSCALL <n>`      | Pops `n` arguments and then the syscall ID from the stack. Executes native syscall. |
| `PUSH_STR <i>`     | Pushes a string from the constant pool. |
| `DUP`              | Duplicates the top value on the stack. |
| `INSWAP`           | Swaps top two elements on the stack. |
| `PRINT`            | Prints the top value (usually for debug). |
| `DEBUG`            | Emits current VM state snapshot (stack, heap, etc.). |
| `NOOP`             | Does nothing. Great for alignment or labels. |

## 🧾 QASM Example

```qasm
LOAD 0        ; Load value from heap at index 0
ALLOC 16      ; Allocates 16 words in the heap
ALLOC_RAW 16  ; Allocates 16 bytes in the raw memory
STORE 0       ; Stores the top of stack in constant pool at index 0
SYSCALL 3     ; Pops 3 args and syscall ID from the stack, performs syscall
```

## 🧘 Philosophy

ProtonVM is built around **intentionality**. No black-box features, no magic optimizations. You know where every byte goes, and why.
